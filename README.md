# python-api-challenge
Pulling API's to analyze weather on a global scale.

9/17/2021 First Major Commit:
- Struggled on setting up initial API requests. 
- I knew I had to loop through each city, but wasn't sure how it would come together as a dataframe.
- My solution (a simple one) was to create and then fill lists with each request, bind them together into a dictionary and make the dataframe from there.
- Added the try/exception for cities that data could not be found for.
- I believe I made the commit after seeing I could successfully export the data to a .csv

9/18/2021 9:50 am Second Commmit:
- Had a little struggle finding the indices for humidity values greater than 100%.
- Otherwise created the indicated scatterplots and then linear regressions by hemisphere.
- Good to have practice with these skills, I think I cleaned up the code and am happy with their look and the analysis.
- Still need to finish analysis on linear regressions.
